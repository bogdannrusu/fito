**Project Description: Fito Coffee**

Fito Coffee is a comprehensive project aimed at building an engaging and functional platform for coffee enthusiasts. The project consists of three main components:

1. **React Website**: The front-end of Fito Coffee is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. The website allows users to explore coffee products, learn about brewing methods, and manage their personal coffee preferences. Reactâ€™s component-based structure ensures a smooth user interface, optimized for performance and scalability.

2. **Electron Desktop Application**: The desktop version of Fito Coffee is developed using Electron, which packages the React web application into a cross-platform desktop app. This allows users to have a native-like experience on their computers, with added features such as offline access, notifications, and enhanced local functionality.

3. **Node.js API**: The back-end of the project is powered by Node.js, serving as the backbone for the data-driven aspects of the platform. This API handles user authentication, product data management, order processing, and communication between the front-end and the database. With Express as a framework, the API is efficient, secure, and scalable.

The combination of React, Electron, and Node.js ensures Fito Coffee is a versatile, high-performance, and user-friendly platform across web and desktop environments.
